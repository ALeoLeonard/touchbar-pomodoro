#Electron TouchBar-Pomodoro App

The TouchBar on the new Macbook Pro has been of little value to me thus far. I wanted to change that so I created an application a Pomodoro Electron application that would run in the touchbar. 

You press 'Start Pomodoro! 💡' to begin.
It starts a 25 minute timer and changes the button to display '👩‍💻 time remaining - ' + workTimeRemaining
When work time is done it rings a bell and the 5 minute break time begins.
The touchbar button displays '💆‍ time remaining - ' + breakTimeRemaining
When the break time is done it rings a bell and returns to the start screen. 


##Setup and running
